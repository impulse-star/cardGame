## security goals

- Prevent Clickjacking attacks
- Encrypt passwords both on server-side and client-side?
    - Look into if its worth storing passwords encrypted? Purpose is usually to prevent data leaks but thats not something we really care about maybe?
    - Look into the server sending over random bit ideas from stackoverflow as a way to encrypt communication between client and server. Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3716003
- HTTPS for the website.
